I am an experienced Software Architect and Developer with a focus on with a focus on designing scaleable and cost-efficient cloud-native solutions. I have a proven expertise in designing and implementing serverless architectures on the AWS platform. I am a strong advocate for best practices in software development, continuous improvement and adaptable architectures. Software designs are never right or complete first time and I believe in an approach of adaptable architecture to ensure you can (re)design and build fast to learn from your mistakes and constantly refine your approach.

I am a hands-on pragmatic full stack developer with experience with many software technologies. Over the last 30+ years I have worked across many areas of front end, middle-ware, back-end, data capture and analysis as well as mobile software development. I have designed and implemented cloud based application solutions and APIs for many types of application, often integrating with legacy technologies. 

I believe that as a Software Architect you need to practice what you preach, and am still involved in the hands-on development of the applications and services I design.
